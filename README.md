## Installation

What a surprise:

```
yarn
```

And even weirder to start (it's nest cli, get over it)

```
yarn start:dev #or [yarn:start]
```

### Real deal

You will need to add discord stuff in env (check .env.sample) and load data (from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api via GETting `:3000/load-jokes`. 
Afterwards you can visit `:3000/invite-bot` to be redirected to add bot page.
